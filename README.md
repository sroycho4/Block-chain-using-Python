# Blockchain Implementation

This project demonstrates a basic implementation of a blockchain using Python. It includes functionality for creating blocks, calculating hashes, encrypting and decrypting data, and validating the blockchain.

## Requirements

To run this project, you need to have the following dependencies installed:

- Python (version 3.6 or higher)
- `pymongo` library
- `cryptography` library

You can install the required libraries using `pip`:

```shell
pip install pymongo cryptography

#Usage
Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/your-username/blockchain.git

#Navigate to the project directory:
cd blockchain

Install the dependencies (if not already installed)

#Update the MongoDB connection string:
Replace the MongoDB connection string in the code with your own connection string. You can obtain a connection string from the MongoDB Atlas dashboard.

Run the code:
python blockchain.py
